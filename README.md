Daily/Weekly Doses Trend: A line chart showing the total doses administered on a daily or weekly basis, helping identify peaks and troughs in the drive.

2. Geographical Analysis (State/UT Level)
A dedicated section for geographical insights, crucial for resource allocation and monitoring high-priority areas.

India Map Visualization: An interactive choropleth map of India displaying key metrics (e.g., total doses administered or percentage of fully vaccinated population) by State/Union Territory. Users can hover or click to see specific state details.

State/UT Leaderboard: Bar charts ranking states by key metrics (e.g., Highest Doses, Highest Percentage of Fully Vaccinated).

Vaccination Velocity: A metric/visual comparing the daily average vaccination rate of a state against the national average.
